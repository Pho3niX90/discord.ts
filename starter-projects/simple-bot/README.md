# Simple Bot

> This starter project demonstrates the bare bones of what can be accomplished with this library.
>
> This Simple Bot will listen for the Ready, Message, MessageDelete, GuildMemberAdd, and GuildCreate Events. It will also listen for a ping and hellothere command that has a '!' before the command.
